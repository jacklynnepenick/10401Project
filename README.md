* First attempt at running LDA on the dataset

    I ran a Latent Dirichlet Allocation tool (https://github.com/mrquincle/gibbs-lda) on the robotics dataset.
    The output seems somewhat promising (lda-trial/model-final.twords contains the top 20 words found for each topic in the dataset), and I plan to look into that more.
